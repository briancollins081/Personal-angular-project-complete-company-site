The scrolling colours are a bit too dark let's try and make it lighter and consistent 

*The images can they be a bit more unique seems like we just took something from an image store. 


*Ask @Ian Adalabs can you guys help brian with some more image designs to give us a unique feel 


We should also add a free trial and demo page. 

I like the concept and the work done so far. Just those few tweaks and we are ready
